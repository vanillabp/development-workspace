# spawn-workspace.sh — create an isolated, devcontainer-ready workspace for one story.
#
# ============================================================================
# FEATURE OVERVIEW
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Branch-driven workspace layout
#    Input branch "feature/FLOW-4711_example" yields workspace
#    <workspaces-root>/<PROJECT_NAME>-FLOW-4711_example/. The branch-path
#    prefix (feature/, bugfix/, ...) is stripped; the leaf becomes the suffix.
#
# 2. Git worktrees instead of fresh clones
#    For each source repo under <workspaces-root>/<PROJECT_NAME>/<repo> (REPOS
#    array in .env.sh) a worktree is created in the new workspace. The script
#    picks one of three strategies per repo:
#      - local branch exists      -> reuse it (and fast-forward to --base if
#                                    the branch has no story-specific commits,
#                                    so a stale leftover from an earlier spawn
#                                    doesn't drag in obsolete content)
#      - only remote branch       -> track origin/<branch>
#      - branch is new            -> fork from --base, otherwise origin/HEAD
#    Worktrees keep the source repo as the single source of truth and avoid
#    duplicating the .git history on disk.
#    Exception -- host-mount entries: a REPOS entry with an EMPTY value (e.g.
#    "hal-npm-packages:") is not a git repo; no worktree is created. Instead the
#    host directory is bind-mounted into the workspace at the same path (mount
#    JSON built alongside NPM_NM_VOLUME_MOUNTS, injected into devcontainer.json).
#    For pre-built artifacts / non-versioned folders. Mono-repo's synthetic
#    "${PROJECT_NAME}:" entry also has an empty value but is a real git repo, so
#    it is excluded via MONO_REPO.
#
# 3. Per-repo base ref for new branches
#    Each entry in REPOS (.env.sh) is "<repo>:<base-ref>". When the branch
#    passed to spawn is brand new, that repo's base ref decides where to
#    fork from: origin/<ref> preferred, falls back to local <ref>; if the
#    repo doesn't know the requested ref at all, falls back to origin/HEAD
#    with a console note. Different repos can use different base refs
#    (e.g. a docs repo on 'main' while the rest forks from 'development').
#
# 4. NO aggregator pom.xml at the workspace root
#    Subprojects' parents (commons-web etc.) don't carry an explicit
#    <relativePath>, so an aggregator would be falsely picked up as parent
#    by Maven, producing "parent.relativePath ... points at <agg>" errors on
#    every sync. We list each subproject's pom in MavenProjectsManager.original
#    Files (.idea/misc.xml) so IntelliJ imports each as a top-level project.
#    post-create.sh builds each repo in dependency order (BUILDS / MAVEN_BUILDS
#    in .env.sh).
#
# 4a. Optional initialization hook (initialize.sh)
#    If dev-containers/initialize.sh exists, spawn-workspace.sh copies it to
#    <workspace>/.devcontainer/initialize.sh and post-create.sh runs it with
#    the workspace root as CWD, right before the Maven warmup builds.
#    Use it for one-time setup that must happen before Maven resolves
#    dependencies (e.g. starting a Docker service that hosts a Maven proxy,
#    seeding a local registry, or pulling DinD images while the network is
#    still available). The file is not created automatically; simply add
#    initialize.sh next to spawn-workspace.sh to activate the hook.
#
# 5. CLAUDE.md, .claude/ and README.md placed at the workspace root
#    Claude Code in the new workspace inherits the same project-level
#    instructions, agents, and skills as the source workspace. .claude/ is
#    seeded by a one-time cp -R, EXCEPT .claude/skills which is additionally
#    bind-mounted back onto ${SOURCE_WS}/.claude/skills (see the mounts array in
#    devcontainer.json). So skills an agent creates or edits inside one story
#    container are shared live with every other container and the base workspace
#    instead of staying trapped in the container copy. A README.md is
#    written at the workspace root (with story-specific port info, first-time
#    setup steps, and the run-config order); IntelliJ's auto-README opener
#    finds it before descending into Maven modules and surfaces it as the
#    opening tab without any FileEditorManager hacks. .idea/ is pre-populated
#    with: .name ("<PROJECT_SHORT> <branch-leaf>") for a distinctive project label,
#    misc.xml pointing the project SDK at JDK 21 (so opening a Java file
#    doesn't prompt "Project JDK is not defined"), compiler.xml enabling
#    annotation processing globally (no Lombok prompt), and run
#    configurations for the projects.
#
# 6. Dev Container with Java 21 + Maven + Node 24 + Git + Docker-in-Docker
#    Built from a tiny local Dockerfile that patches the MS base image
#    (mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/java:1-21-bookworm) by removing its
#    expired Yarn apt source -- otherwise every feature's apt-get update
#    fails with exit code 100. Features add Maven (via SDKMAN, the java:1
#    feature with version=none + installMaven=true so we keep the base image's
#    Java but get the SDKMAN-managed mvn), Node 24, Git, and a per-container
#    Docker daemon (DinD) so each story's testcontainers/compose stacks are
#    isolated and never collide on container names or host ports. The DinD
#    feature relies on its own entrypoint to start dockerd, but JetBrains
#    Gateway overrides the entrypoint -- so post-start.sh kicks dockerd on
#    every container start (idempotent, with a TCP listener on 127.0.0.1:2375
#    as a fallback to the unix socket, mirroring the GitLab CI dind setup).
#    JetBrains backend is preselected via customizations.jetbrains.backend.
#
# 6a. Per-module node_modules on Docker named volumes
#    Every npm module (each package.json outside node_modules/.git) gets its
#    node_modules mounted as a Docker named volume instead of living in the
#    bind-mounted workspace (NPM_NM_VOLUME_MOUNTS, injected into
#    devcontainer.json). Rationale: on macOS Docker Desktop the
#    Virtualization.framework bridges every file of a bind mount between the
#    Linux VM and the host; for node_modules with tens of thousands of files
#    npm becomes 10-100x slower. Named volumes live on the VM's own ext4 fs,
#    so npm writes at Linux-native speed. dispose-workspace.sh removes these
#    volumes automatically via `docker inspect` on the container. Caveat: a
#    freshly created named volume is owned by root:root, but the warmup build
#    (and the IDE) run as vscode -- so post-create.sh (feature 12) chowns each
#    node_modules mount-point to vscode before any npm/Maven step touches it,
#    otherwise npm dies with "EACCES: permission denied, mkdir .../@types".
#
# 7. Constant in-container workspace path: /workspaces/<PROJECT_NAME>
#    Every story container mounts the workspace at the same path. Claude Code
#    encodes the project key from the cwd, so this gives every container the
#    SAME memory key (-workspaces-<PROJECT_NAME>), which is what makes the
#    shared memory bind below actually align across containers. The story workspace
#    is ALSO bind-mounted at its host path, plus the source workspace, so git
#    worktree references resolve inside the container (without those binds,
#    git in the container can't read worktree metadata and reports every
#    repo as "not a git repository").
#
# 8. Layered Claude state: shared memory, isolated history
#    Three mounts stack on /home/vscode/.claude (deeper paths win):
#      a. bind   ~/.claude                                                  -> share login, user agents, slash commands
#      b. volume <PROJECT_SHORT>-claude-project-${devcontainerId} on .../projects/<key> -> isolate per-project state (history, todos, sessions)
#      c. bind   ~/.claude/projects/<key>/memory                            -> bring memory/ back to a single shared host folder
#    Effect: persistent memory across container rebuilds AND shared between
#    parallel story containers, but conversation history stays per-story.
#    ~/.claude.json is bind-mounted as a sibling so the API/auth config is
#    shared too.
#
# 9. Host integration mounts (read-only where appropriate)
#    ~/.ssh is mounted readonly so git finds keys out of the box. ~/.m2 is
#    mounted writable so the Maven cache survives container rebuilds and is
#    shared across stories. The host's glab config directory is mounted
#    writable onto the container's ~/.config/glab-cli; spawn-workspace.sh
#    resolves the host path per OS (macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/
#    glab-cli, Linux: ~/.config/glab-cli) so the GitLab CLI login flows
#    between host and container regardless of platform. Likewise the host's
#    ~/.config/gh (same path on every OS) is mounted writable onto the
#    container's ~/.config/gh so the GitHub CLI (gh) login is shared; gh is
#    installed in the image (GH_VERSION in .env.sh) and wired as git's HTTPS
#    credential helper for github.com via 'gh auth setup-git'. ~/.npmrc is NOT
#    bind-mounted: spawn-workspace.sh
#    resolves the host file at spawn time (strips /Users/... paths, substitutes
#    ${TOKEN_NAME}-style placeholders for every var in FORWARDED_ENV_VARS with
#    the spawn shell's value) and writes .devcontainer/host-npmrc.resolved
#    into the workspace, which post-create copies to /home/vscode/.npmrc.
#    We tried bind-mounting before but JetBrains' devcontainer setup didn't
#    surface the mount under /tmp on this user's Docker, leaving npm without
#    auth. Going through the workspace bind is reliable. ~/.gitconfig is NOT
#    bind-mounted: JetBrains writes user.name/user.email into the container's
#    gitconfig itself, and a bind mount on a single file breaks git's atomic
#    rename ("Device or resource busy"). FORWARDED_ENV_VARS entries are also
#    forwarded via remoteEnv as a fallback for tools that re-read env at runtime.
#
# 10. runArgs: --name <PROJECT_SHORT>-<leaf>
#    Names the underlying Docker container after the branch leaf so it is
#    visible as e.g. "<PROJECT_SHORT>-FLOW-4711_example" in `docker ps` and Docker Desktop.
#    JetBrains' devcontainer-id label in its UI still shows a hash, but Docker
#    tooling now identifies stories by their branch name.
#
#    Port offset (multiple of 10000): spawn-workspace.sh probes the host for
#    free ports and picks the lowest offset where 4200/5173/8079/8080/9080 are
#    all free. The probe checks BOTH currently-bound listeners AND host ports
#    statically reserved by other story workspaces' devcontainer.json files,
#    so a stopped (but not disposed) workspace can't be unstuck-into-conflict
#    when its container is later restarted. Default offset is 0 (same numbers
#    on host and container). forwardPorts uses host:container syntax so the
#    container itself stays on its native ports (no Spring server.port
#    override needed). OAuth callback / issuer URIs that *do* depend on the
#    host-visible port (cockpit's redirect-uri, auth server's registered
#    redirect-uris, issuer-uri) are passed as JVM system properties in the
#    run configs so that browser-side OAuth flows still match.
#
# 11. initializeCommand prepares host-side bind targets
#     Creates ~/.m2, ~/.ssh, ~/.claude, the shared memory directory, and
#     touches ~/.claude.json so Docker doesn't create them as root-owned
#     dirs on first mount.
#
# 12. postCreateCommand warms the build (and waitFor blocks the IDE on it)
#     Installs Claude Code globally, fixes ownership on the per-story Claude
#     project volume, exposes 'mvn' and 'claude' as symlinks under
#     /usr/local/bin so non-login IDE terminals find them, drops a 'branches'
#     helper script that prints each worktree's current branch, chowns the
#     per-module node_modules named volumes to vscode (fresh named volumes are
#     root:root, so npm running as vscode would otherwise die with EACCES on
#     'mkdir node_modules/@types' -- see the node_modules volume mounts in
#     feature 6a / NPM_NM_VOLUME_MOUNTS), then resolves the Maven reactor in
#     dependency order (BUILDS / MAVEN_BUILDS). Tests (unit/integration/E2E)
#       are not part of the warmup -- run them on demand from the IDE.
#     "waitFor": "postCreateCommand" makes IntelliJ block on this completing
#     before opening the project window, so the IDE's first index pass sees
#     a fully resolved reactor instead of an empty workspace.
#
# Companion script: bin/dispose-workspace.sh removes a workspace and prunes
# its worktrees.

# ============================================================================
#
# Layout:
#   <workspaces-root>/<PROJECT_NAME>/                   (source workspace, read by this script)
#   <workspaces-root>/<PROJECT_NAME>-<branch-leaf>/     (created by this script)
#
# The <workspaces-root> directory is resolved in this order:
#   1. --workspaces-root <path>            CLI flag (highest priority)
#   2. $<PROJECT_SHORT>_WORKSPACES_ROOT    environment variable (e.g. VANILLABP_WORKSPACES_ROOT)
#   3. auto-detect: parent of the directory holding this script, i.e. the
#                   source workspace's parent
# Regardless of source, the script prints the resolved target workspace
# directory and asks for confirmation before creating anything; pass --yes
# to skip the prompt for scripted use.
#
# Usage:
#   dev-containers/spawn-workspace.sh [--workspaces-root <path>] [--yes] <branch-name>

# bridges every file read/write between the Linux VM and the macOS bind-mount.
# For storybook-scale packages (40 000+ files in node_modules), this XPC bridge
# becomes the bottleneck -- the process holds 40 000+ open file descriptors while
# npm is still writing, making npm 10-100x slower.
#
# Fix: mount each module's node_modules as a Docker named volume instead of
# letting it live in the bind-mounted workspace. Named volumes are backed by the
# Docker VM's own ext4 filesystem; the Virtualization.framework never touches
# individual files inside them. npm writes at Linux-native speed.
#
# Naming: ${PROJECT_SHORT}-${LEAF}-<slug>-nm, where <slug> is the module's

# DELIBERATELY NOT seeding .idea/spotless-applier.xml here.
#
# Spotless Applier (Lipiridi, v1.2.3) has two upstream bugs that surface in
# the ijent-based Dev Container mode introduced in JetBrains Gateway 2025.x:
#   1. SpotlessOnSaveOptions.getInstance() lazy-loads on the save listener path
#      and triggers PathMacroManager.expandPaths() -> MavenUtil resolving the
#      default local Maven repository via EelProvider.toEelApiBlocking() on EDT.
#      Eel asserts "no blocking calls on EDT" and the save crashes with
#      IllegalStateException.
#   2. The -DspotlessIdeHook=<file> argument is built from VirtualFile.getPath()
#      without Eel mapping, so it ends up as the literal virtual scheme
#      //$devcontainer.ij/<hash>@/workspaces/... which the in-container mvn
#      process cannot resolve -> notification says "Spotless applied" but the
#      file is unchanged.
# Both bugs only manifest in ijent mode; on host the plugin works fine because
# there is no Eel layer in between.
#
# Seeding .idea/spotless-applier.xml with myRunOnSave=true would cause bug 1
# on every first save in a new workspace. Until the plugin learns Eel (or the
# user switches to classic-Gateway-backend mode), the file is intentionally
# not created. Use IntelliJ's built-in "Reformat code" / "Optimize imports"
# Actions on Save (Settings -> Tools -> Actions on Save) plus a pre-commit
# 'mvn spotless:apply' instead.

# Enable annotation processing globally so IntelliJ stops asking "Enable
# Lombok?" when opening a Java file with @Data / @Builder / @Slf4j. The
# default profile applies to every module unless an explicit per-module
# profile is defined, so this single entry covers the whole reactor.

# Chromium for the 'bpmn-to-image' CLI (installed via npm in post-create.sh).
# bpmn-to-image drives a headless Chrome through Puppeteer to render BPMN
# diagrams to PNG/SVG/PDF. Puppeteer's own bundled Chrome-for-Testing has NO
# linux-arm64 build: on Apple-silicon hosts it downloads the x86-64 binary,
# which Docker Desktop's Rosetta can only run if the image ships the x86 ELF
# loader (/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2). The MS arm64 base image doesn't, so a
# render dies with "rosetta error: failed to open elf at /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2".
# Fix: install the distro's native Chromium (arm64 on Apple silicon, amd64 on
# Intel) and point Puppeteer at it, skipping its own download entirely.
#   - PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD (Puppeteer >= 20) suppresses the postinstall
#     browser fetch, so 'npm install -g bpmn-to-image' pulls no ~500 MB x86
#     Chrome. PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD is the legacy name, kept for
#     older Puppeteer transitive versions.
#   - PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH makes puppeteer.launch() use the system binary;
#     bpmn-to-image needs no patch because it honours a plain launch().
# These are Dockerfile ENV (not containerEnv/remoteEnv) so they also apply

# and its config (with the auth token) is bind-mounted from the host, so
# the helper returns the stored token without prompting. Result: 'git push'
# over HTTPS to that host works silently.
#
# We do NOT wire glab's own 'glab auth git-credential' subcommand directly,
# because three things conspire to make plain wiring prompt for a password
# on every operation:
#   (a) glab declares 'capability[]=authtype' in its response but does not
#       use the authtype protocol's actual auth fields. git 2.46+ treats
#       this as a malformed response and falls through to a prompt.
#   (b) glab rejects 'get' requests whose 'username=<x>' field does not
#       match its OAuth-login state (empty username), erroring out with
#       'want "" but got "<x>"'. The repos here have URLs of the form
#       https://<user>@git.example.com/..., so git always passes the
#       URL-embedded username to the helper.
#   (c) GitLab expects 'oauth2' as the HTTP Basic username for OAuth-flow
#       tokens, not the user's own login name. Without the override, the
#       helper-returned empty username triggers git to fall back to the
#       URL username, which GitLab then rejects with 'HTTP Basic: Access
#       denied'.

# Fix ownership of the per-module node_modules Docker named volumes.
# Each npm module's node_modules is mounted as a named volume (see
# devcontainer.json / NPM_NM_VOLUME_MOUNTS) so npm writes at Linux-native speed
# instead of through the slow macOS bind-mount. A freshly created named volume
# is owned by root:root, though, so npm running as vscode during the Maven
# warmup below can't write into it and dies with
#   EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '.../node_modules/@types'
# chown each mount-point to vscode up front. The find mirrors the module
# discovery in spawn-workspace.sh (package.json outside node_modules/.git), so
# it stays in sync with the volumes actually mounted -- no extra placeholder
# needed. Non-recursive is enough: npm creates everything below once it owns
# the mount root.
# The prune expression spliced in below (may be empty) skips any host-mounted
# repo dirs (REPOS entries with an empty base-ref): they carry no named-volume
# node_modules, and chowning anything inside them would rewrite ownership of the
# bind-mounted HOST files. The `if` (not `&&`) keeps a module without a
# node_modules dir from making the loop -- and thus the whole pipeline under

# Step 4: turn off IntelliJ's "Use safe write" in every existing remote backend

# bind-mounts produces a new inode + ctime drift that IntelliJ's external-
# change detector reads as "someone else touched the file" -> "Datei wurde
# extern geaendert" dialog right after every save. Disabling it makes the
# editor write the file in place (open+truncate+write), preserving the inode.
#
# NOTE: this block only fires for the CLASSIC Gateway mode where a full IDE
# backend runs INSIDE the container and writes its config to
# ~/.config/JetBrains/RemoteDev-IU/<hash>/options/. In the current ijent-based
# Dev Container mode (Gateway 2025.x / 2026.x default) the IDE runs on the
# HOST and ijent runs in the container as a thin file proxy -- no container-
# side config dir exists, so the glob below is empty and the loop is a no-op.
# In ijent mode the equivalent fix is to disable "Use safe write" ONCE in the
# host IDE (Settings -> Appearance & Behavior -> System Settings, restart
# required); that setting applies globally to every IntelliJ project, remote
# and local. The block is kept here as forward-compat for the classic mode.
#
# The Gateway backend creates its config dir on first connect and names it
# RemoteDev-IU/_<workspace-hash>; the hash is not knowable from here, so we
# glob. On the very first container start the dir doesn't exist yet -> the
# loop is a no-op and the dialog still appears for that first session. After
# the first connect (and any subsequent container start) the setting is
